# Copilot Instructions for Agentic AI

## Project Overview
This project appears to be a minimal Python workspace named `agentic-ai`. The current structure includes:
- `main.py`: Entry point (currently empty)
- `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata, Python version >=3.14, no listed dependencies
- `requirment.txt`: Only `ipykernel` listed
- `test.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook (one code cell, not executed)
- `env/`: Python virtual environment

## Architecture & Patterns
- No code or architectural patterns are present yet. The project is a blank slate.
- No service boundaries, data flows, or integration points are defined.
- No custom conventions or project-specific patterns are discoverable.

## Developer Workflows
- **Environment**: Use the `env/` folder for the Python virtual environment.
- **Dependencies**: Install dependencies from `requirment.txt` (currently only `ipykernel`).
- **Notebook**: Use `test.ipynb` for experimentation; ensure `ipykernel` is installed.
- **Python Version**: Requires Python >=3.14 (as specified in `pyproject.toml`).

## Integration & External Dependencies
- No integrations or external APIs are defined.
- Only dependency is `ipykernel` for Jupyter notebook support.

## Key Files
- `main.py`: Intended entry point, currently empty.
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration.
- `requirment.txt`: Python package requirements.
- `test.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for testing.

## Example Workflow
1. Create and activate the virtual environment in `env/`.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirment.txt`.
3. Run or edit `test.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
4. Develop in `main.py` as needed.

**Note:** This project is currently a skeleton. Update this file as code and conventions are added.
